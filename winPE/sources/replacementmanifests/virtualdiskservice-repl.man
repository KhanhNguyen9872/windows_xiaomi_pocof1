  <!--
      This manifest is used to gather settings for migration from Vista and WS08
      because those builds shipped with an incorrect manifest.

      As this manifest is only used to  gather settings,  it does not need the
      supportedComponents and merge elements.

      The only settings that we need to gather from Vista and WS08 is the list
      of registered hardware providers and the alignment values.

      The  machineSpecific element informs the  migration engine  to limit our
      participation to inplace upgrades only and to not include us in PC-to-PC
      migration scenarios such as WET, USMT, etc.
    
      This manifest is not compiled and hence should not include  build macros
